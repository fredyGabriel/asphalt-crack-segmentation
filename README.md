# Asphalt Crack Segmentation Project

This project implements deep learning models for the segmentation of cracks in
asphalt pavement. The goal is to accurately identify and segment cracks from
images of asphalt surfaces, which can be useful for maintenance and repair
planning.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required
dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data` directory. Ensure
that images and their corresponding masks are organized properly.

2. **Training the Model**: Run the training script to start training the U-Net
model:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Model**: After training, you can evaluate the model's
performance on a validation dataset:

   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Running Inference**: To use the trained model for inference on new images,
run:

   ```
   python inference.py
   ```

## Modules

- **Data Module**: Contains classes and functions for loading and preprocessing
the dataset.
- **Models Module**: Implements the U-Net architecture for image segmentation.
- **Utils Module**: Provides custom loss functions and evaluation metrics.
- **Configs**: Contains configuration settings for the project.
